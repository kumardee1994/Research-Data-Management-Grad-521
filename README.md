My research question is “what would be effect of optimization of efficiency of construction equipment on cost of construction project”.
The question would address ways of finding effects on cost of construction project by decreasing or increasing efficiency. For methodology of the project, I have thought of two ways to calculate efficiency and see their results on construction efficiency. One way of calculating efficiency is using accelerometer on construction equipment on construction site. This way, we can track efficiency under actual construction site condition. Another way of calculating construction efficiency is using simulation to calculate efficiency under controlled environment. The cost will be calculated for results of both ways of efficiency and cost will be compared.
